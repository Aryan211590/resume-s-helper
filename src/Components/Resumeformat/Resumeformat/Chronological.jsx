          <h3>What is a Chronological Resume?</h3>

          <div className="object_design_content">
            <p> The most well-known resume format type is the chronological resume, often favored by human resource specialists for its all-encompassing style..</p>
          </div>
            <p>The Chronological Resume is the traditional resume structure, which is also known as the reverse-chronological resume, as it refers to the manner in which the work experience is listed, starting from the most recent position and working backwards.</p>
            <p>Employers generally like the chronological resume format because it is the easiest to skim read and offers the information that they’re looking for in a straightforward layout. It provides an overview of your career history, showing your progression and highlighting accomplishments throughout.</p>
            <p>Recent findings by The Ladders show you’ve got only 7.4 seconds to make an impression on a recruiter. A chronological resume is your best friend in making your file extra skimmable for today’s hiring managers.</p>
            <p>The main body of the chronological resume is made up of the timeline of work experience of each candidate, wherein it is useful to detail the responsibilities and achievements of each position.</p>
            <p>The chronological resume structure usually includes an objective or summary statement to begin with and follows with the reverse chronological list of positions held and respective details and finally also includes the academic career of each candidate.</p>
            <p>Some may choose to include more sections depending on their personal experience and the position they’re applying for. These sections could include skills, volunteering experience or publications for example.</p>
            <h3>Pros and Cons of the Chronological Resume</h3>         

            <div className="object_design_content">
                <p>Read on for the advantages and disadvantages of the chronological resume format to help you decide if this is the style of resume structure that best fits your field and professional profile.</p>
            </div>

<p>Chronological resumes are excellent resources for job applications for candidates with an obvious vertical career path, for those who have lots of experience in a certain area or expertise in a specific field or industry and wish to progress in that same discipline.</p>
          <div className="object_design_content">
            <ul>
                <b>Pros</b>
              <li>
              One of the advantages of the chronological resume format is that it allows you to indicate all the various responsibilities or accomplishments from different positions in bullet point form or in a descriptive paragraph following each job. This permits the hiring manager to see not only the work history with the corresponding dates, job title and company, but also to review the achievements and functions that the candidate managed while in that position.
              </li>
              <li>From the three types of resume formats, the chronological resume layout is potentially the easiest because it is essentially a list of past experiences that does not require much analysis and it is also the preferred choice for many employers due to its easy-to-read structure.</li>
              <li>
              Another positive aspect of the chronological resume is that as it is the most common and routine of the resume styles, it is easily read by Applicant Tracking Systems (currently used by 99% of Fortune 500 companies). This means that if the categories, keywords and general information is clear, it is more likely to survive the first round of eliminations. A surefire way to get an ATS-ready resume is by using a resume template
              </li>
              
            </ul>
          </div>
          <br></br>
          <div className="object_design_content">
            <ul>
                <b>Cons</b>
              <li>
              It is not necessarily the best type of resume format for jobseekers who have periods of work history where they are unemployed for whatever reason or if they have changed companies or job roles many times.
              </li>
              <li>Nor is the chronological resume format ideal for changing careers as it focuses heavily on the experience the candidate can offer, which is not usually the strength for someone looking to change profession.</li>
              <li>
              Another disadvantage of the chronological resume is that as it is so well-known, it can be hard to make your resume stand out as the general rule of this style is that it is not creative or eye-catching. Hiring managers can see this as positive as it reduces prejudices but of course it does not allow for employers to see much of the candidate’s personality, thus all applicants are reduced to their academic and professional abilities and experience.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>In cases like these, it is more appropriate to use other types of resume formats such as the functional or combination resume.</p>
