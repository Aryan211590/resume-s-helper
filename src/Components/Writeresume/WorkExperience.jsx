                    <p>A resume objective follows the contact information and acts as an introduction to you as a candidate. It’s important not to underestimate the clout of this short paragraph. Forbes Magazine estimates that many hiring managers consider the initial summary the most important part of a resume, and they’ll expect one from yours.</p>

                    <h3>How to show your professional experience on your resume</h3>
                    <p>Most employers deem the work experience section the most vital part of your resume, as your career path is often the clearest, efficient way to explain your skills. It lists companies you’ve worked for, industries you are familiar with, skills you have acquired, and the contributions you’ve delivered along the way.
                    </p>
                    <p>This core part of your resume can be titled in a variety of ways. A few common examples are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Work Experience</li>
                        <li>Professional Experience</li>
                        <li>Relevant Experience</li>
                        <li>Work History</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Choose a title that is most appropriate for your experience when learning how to write the experience section on a resume. For example, students may include internships or part-time positions, which qualify as “work” experience but are not related to their target roles. A title such as “Work Experience” or “work History” would suffice in this case, to show that you have experience working a job consistently.</p>
                    <p>If you are still a little lost, try using a resume template or an online resume builder which includes helpful examples and practical tips for completing the work experience section on your resume.</p>
                    <h3>How to write the work experience section on your resume</h3>
                    <p>One of the easiest ways to capture the attention of a hiring manager is to list your professional experience in a clear, concise, and visually interesting manner.</p>
                    <div className="object_design_content">
                        <p>Top tip: your work experience section should always follow a reverse chronological frame, regardless of the resume format you choose (chronological, combined, or functional).</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>To start, begin with the most recent position held and work backward in time. Many job coaches and recruiters suggest that you only detail positions held within the last 10 to 15 years, as anything prior to those dates will be irrelevant and excessive in detail.</p>
                    <p>How you display this information is crucial. An inconsistent, out-of-order format will only confuse the reader and earn your resume a trip to the trash bin.</p>
                    As with every section on your resume, make sure to highlight information that explains your past accomplishments, successes, contributions, and learnings. The more they relate to the position at hand, the better.
                    <h3>When to use a resume objective</h3>
                    <b>Whether you opt for a resume objective depends on the type of resume structure you use.</b>
                    <p>Though common, not all resume layouts and/or formats are suited for a resume objective. For example, mid-level professionals might leverage a qualifications section or summary statement as a starting point, while entry-level professionals may incorporate a resume objective that plainly states their career goals and the purpose of the application.

                    <h3>What to include in a resume experience section</h3>
                    <p>It’s best to collect all of your work histories first before starting to write your experience section. Gather all experiences you’ve gained in the last 10 to 15 years.

                    </p>
                    <p>For most job seekers, their work experience will be true professional jobs/positions. But for students or recent graduates, relevant work “experience” can also include:</p>
                    <b>Common uses for a resume objective:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Internships
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Volunteer work
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Study abroad programs
                        </li>
                        <li>Leaderships in clubs or community teams</li>
                        <p>Next, it is time to detail your experience. Start with your most recent position and work backward.</p>
                        <b>Each job post should include the following elements:</b>
                        <li>Job title</li>
                        <li>Employer/company name</li>
                        <li>Location (City, State or “remote”)</li>
                        <li>Dates of employment</li>
                        <li>Details of your accomplishments and contributions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Some of these details are unnecessary in functional resume layouts. For example, in cases where you may have large gaps in your job history, a functional resume layout can help downplay the scattered timeline of your employment and highlight the skills you’ve learned and will bring to the next position.</p>

                    <p>Most importantly, each job post should include a brief paragraph, or more commonly, a bullet-point list of your responsibilities. Each position listed should prioritize your achievements and contributions to the role. Do not simply list the “responsibilities” or “daily tasks” of the job.</p>
                    <b>Include quantifiable examples of your success, as 34% of recruiters won’t consider applications that are not specific to the role, according to CareerBuilder.</b>

                    <p>Keep your work experience section as focused as possible and only list those statements which are relevant to your target jobs. Forbes Magazine suggests limiting yourself to five bullet points per position.</p>
                    <p>Action verbs can significantly increase the impact your resume content has on the reader, enticing them enough to reach out for an interview. Include a variety of action verbs in each of your bullet points.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Examples of effective action verbs to use on your resume: launched; implemented; spearheaded; coordinated; directed; increased; restructured; acquired; grew; saved; cut; identified, etc.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <b>Top tip: Use a different resume objective for each job and tailor each objective to the sector and position you’re applying for.</b>
                    <p>Remember to write your resume objective using dynamic language, including action verbs and compelling adjectives regarding your abilities and experience. Here are a few other quick tips for writing a resume objective:</p>
                    <div className="object_design_content">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Mention skills that can be proven throughout your resume using real examples of that skill in action in your work history.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Include unique characteristics, personally or professionally, which you have developed through particular activities. For example, active listening, mentorship, persuasion, or empathy.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Use keywords from the job description, as well as those common in your industry.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                List briefly any qualifications or certificates you hold to demonstrate proficiency and expertise.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Add the years of experience in the role or industry, especially if you are applying for a similar position or company.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to writing a resume objective, it is important to keep this section short and to the point. What you advertise in your objective should reflect core elements of your professional profile and be reiterated later on in the resume.</p>
